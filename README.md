# Footprint

Footprint is a React application which easily calculates a user's eco-footprint based on the user's lifestyle. People can learn how to reduce their footprint by taking the quiz and seeing how they compare to the average.

## Use the app:
* [Launch app](https://infinite-badlands-27209.herokuapp.com)

  res.set('user', {expires: Date.now()});
  res.json(true);
});
```


## Future Features

In the future, we hope to incorporate the following features:

* Carbon Footprint APIs to give users a number they can improve on

* Stripe or Paypal for donations to non-profits focusing on the environment 

* D3 or Chartio to display data visualizations and infographs of user results

* API or calculate ways users can alleviate high carbon footprint

* Allow social media sharing of user results
